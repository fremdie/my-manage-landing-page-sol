## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework


### What I learned

This was my first time learning Tailwind. I learnt how to use the classes components to style my design.


### Continued development

I loved learning to use Tailwindcss and I will continue to practice so that I can become better at it.
